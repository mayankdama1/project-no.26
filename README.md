MASTER CHEF
the ratio of water and rice flour has to be respected here. do not attempt to add less or more water as it may end up in disaster. you may not be able to shape it if the proportions are not matched. secondly, once the dough is formed, it may dry out while making these modaks. even if it is dry, do not add water and wet your hands and then try to shape it. lastly, if you find pleating is cumbersome, you may shape it like karanji too. it would not be termed as modak but would be of the same taste.
